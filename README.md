## Prerequisites ✅

- Node.js (v16 or newer) and npm
- Git

## Setup 🔧

1. Clone the repository and change into it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kiranb297/assignmentNQ.git
   cd assignmentNQ
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Playwright browsers (required for browser tests):
   ```bash
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   ```

> The project uses the configuration in `playwright.config.ts`.

---

## Run tests ▶️

- Run all tests:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test
  ```

- Run a single test file:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test src/tests/login.spec.ts
  ```

- Run tests in headed (visible) mode:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --headed
  ```

- Run a test by title (grep):
  ```bash
  npx playwright test -g "Successful Login with Valid Credentials"
  ```

- Debug tests interactively:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --debug
  ```

---
## View reports 📊
- Open the HTML report generated by Playwright:
  ```bash
  npx playwright show-report
  ```
  Or open `playwright-report/index.html` in your browser.

---
## Continuous Integration (CI) 🧪

- This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`) that runs `npx playwright test` on push/PR.

---
## npm scripts

For convenience, the repository includes useful npm scripts. After installing dependencies, run:

```bash
npm run test        # run Playwright tests
npm run test:headed # run tests in headed mode
npm run report      # show the HTML report
npm run tsc         # run TypeScript check
npm run lint        # run ESLint
```

---

## Notes 💡
- If running tests locally, make sure Playwright browsers are installed: `npx playwright install --with-deps`.
- Tests live under `src/tests` (see `src/tests/login.spec.ts`).
- The tests use helpers in `src/pages` and `src/helper`.
